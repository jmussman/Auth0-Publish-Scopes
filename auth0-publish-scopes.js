 * long as the source is attributed.
 * 
 * Add an 'x-permissions' claim to the ID token which contains a list of permissions (scopes)
 * the user is allowed for the application authentication is performed for. The application
 * may use x-permissions as the known permissions to request for an access token. This moves
 * the configuration of which users have what permissions from the application data store
 * to the administration of the identity provider (Auth0).
 * 
 * This Action only handles permissions for a single back-end API. Multiple APIs may be
 * handled by extending it with additional claims for each API.
 * 
 * The authorication object has the list of roles the user has been assigned. But, it is a
 * complete list, so this function retrieves the list of roles the application supports from
 * the application metadata, and produces the intersection of those two lists.
 * 
 * Once the list of roles for the user->application is determined, the management API is
 * used extract the ID of each role, and then the permissions from each of those roles.
 * The permissions are published as an array of strings in the ID token as 'x-permissions'.
 * The list of permissions is the list of scopes for the application to request from
 * /authorize for the API access token.
 * 
 * To configure this a machine-to-machine application needs to be configured in the tenant
 * which will talk to the default 'Auth0 Management API' to make management API requests.
 * The roles required for this application to service this action are 'read:users',
 * 'read:roles','read:role_members'. Store the domain and credentials in the Action
 * secrets: 'domain', 'clientId', and 'clientSecret'.
 * 
 * Add the 'auth0' Node.js dependency at the latest version, and add the secrets for
 * *domain*, *clientId*, and *clientSecret* from the M2M application configuration.
