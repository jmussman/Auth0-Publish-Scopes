# Auth0-Publish-Scopes

## Overview

Which scopes an application should request for a particular user when obtaining an access token is a common problem in OAuth2-aware applications.
The easy solution is to request the same scopes for all users.
It is hardwired and everyone gets the same access at the web service (API).

What if some users have more access than others?
Well then one solution is the application keeps a database of what scopes to ask for what user.
That database has to agree with the permissions granted to the user by the authorization server.
Maintaining the information in two places is a recipe for mistakes and disagreement.

So if the authorization server knows what permissions are granted, and therefore what scopes may be added to the access token claims, why
not just add all of them?
Well, that voilates "least privilege"; uncessary scopes listed lead to possible accidents and open the possibility of more damage if a
token is compromised!
That is the reason that applications request specific scopes.

So the authorization server manages the permissions for a user, and ought to be able to tell the application what scopes are authorized to be granted for that specific user.
The easy way to do this is to add a claim to the ID token when it is requested, and then the application can learn what permissions the
user is granted and ask for the specific permissions it wants from that set.

This is one of a series of action examples that may be used as a foundation for building
what you need.
Search GitHub for *jmussman/auth0* to find other examples in the series.

## Implementation

This implementation depends on *roles*.
In Auth0 tenants permissions are defined by API configurations, and specific permissions for users are attached to roles assigned to users.
When /authorize is called for a user, all of the roles the user is assigned are listed in the event passed to the post-login action flow.
That event also has the list of roles assigned to the application.
The first step is to calculate the intersection of the user and application roles, that is what is possible for the user in the application.

The second step is to extract the specific permissions for the set of roles.
The post-login action needs to use the management API to find all the roles, filter that specifically to the roles the user has,
and then extract the permissions assigned to each of those roles.

The extracted list of permissions can be added as a claim to the ID token, in this case 'x-permissions' is used as the claim name.
The application can access that claim, select all or a subset of the permissions, and then make the request for the access token
to call the API.

## Configuration

This assumes basic knowledge of working with actions and adding actions to flows in Auth0.
This is an overview of the configuration that must be established.

### Steps

1. Create or use an existing M2M application configuration that has *read:roles* permission in the Management API.
2. Create a new post-login action using the code in the *auth0-publish-scopes.js* file.
3. Add the *auth0* Node.js package as a dependency for the action.
4. Add secrets for *domain*, *clientId*, and *clientSecret* using the values from the application in step 1.
5. Add a secret *debug* with a value of true for console messages during testing, clear it for production. A re-deployment is neccessary after changing a secret.
6. Save and deploy the action in the post-login flow.
